  - repository linux-toradex branch toradex_vf_4.1
  - repository u-boot-toradex branch 2015.04-toradex

********************************************************************************
Linux Image V2.5 Beta 1 (August 13, 2015)
- U-Boot:
  - Improve TFTP transfer speed by using increased block size
  - Introduce m4boot command which accept a FIT image to boot the secondary
    Cortex-M4 core
  - Pass U-Boot MTD partitions to the kernel by using device tree fix-up
  - Use ARM Global Timer instead of PIT Timer (avoids conflicts with Cortex-M4)
  - Clock and mux Colibri UART_B (UART2) by default
  - Add fdt_fixup variable to make it easier to include scripts which fix-up
    the kernel's device tree (e.g. for evaluation/testing purpose)
  - Set DDR fix property in the kernel's device tree to enable
    Suspend-to-Memory support
- Linux kernel:
  - Update to 4.1.5 LTS long term stable Linux kernel
  - Initial Suspend-to-Memory support using Vybrid's LPSTOP2 low power mode
    ("echo mem > /sys/power/state")
  - Fixed and enhanced suspend/resume functions in various drivers
  - Framebuffer ioctl WAITFORVSYNC which allows to synchronize buffer swap
    on vertical blanking period
  - Support RS485 transceiver on UARTs
  - Updated default configuration: Include all drivers necessary to support
    USB mass storage, add PWM LED, HWMON IIO and PL2303 serial device support
    by default, configure more drivers as modules (e.g. UVC webcam), and
    add some Wi-Fi drivers as module too
- Linux user-space:
  - Update OpenEmbedded from dizzy to fido:
    - glibc 2.21
    - systemd 219
    - Xorg 1.16.3
  - Removed udev-extra-rules (e.g. automount.rules/mount.sh) since the LXDE
    image handles automounting using udisk. Newer systemd variants also start
    udev using MountFlags=slave leading to mountpoints being mounted by the
    udev rules not accessible by other processes.

  - repository linux-toradex branch toradex_vf_4.1
  - repository u-boot-toradex branch 2015.04-toradex

Note:
- Due to flash space constraints we recommend using the console only image on
  Colibri VF50 (e.g. Colibri_VF_LinuxConsoleImageV2.5Beta1_20150813.tar.bz2).
- The kernel requires the device tree from within the root filesystem to
  boot. Board customisation within code are for most use cases not necessary.
  For custom carrier boards it is recommended to create a customised device
  tree file and deploy it in the root filesystem's /boot directory.
  U-Boot reads the device tree according to the following naming scheme:
  => ${soc}-colibri-${fdt_board}.dtb

  Hence, a custom carrier board needs to set the fdt_board variable accordingly
  and would name the device tree files using the SoC prefix depending on the
  supported module type:
  => vf500-colibri-mycarrier.dtb
  => vf610-colibri-mycarrier.dtb

Known Issues:
- If the module does not boot, remove all displays connected to HSYNC, VSYNC and reset.
  (This has been observed on an Evaluation Board V2.1C)
- Suspend-to-Memory: USB devices on the USB host port get disconnected on resume
- Standby: Wake-up using UART in DMA mode hangs

  instead, then the usual "run update"
- Boot from SD-card does not work out of the box, sddtbparm net to be updated:

Note:
- We use now zImage instead of uImage kernel image format and moved the kernel
  inside the root filesystem. If you use custom U-Boot scripts, you need to
  alter those scripts accordingly.

  - Enable RTS/CTS on UART_A aka UART0 and UART_B aka UART2.
  - Integrate backlight using both BL_ON GPIO and PWM<A>.
  - Re-worked IOMUX pin muxing.
  - Disable magic SysRq key configuration as this is not only a potential
       security thread but can cause serious trouble if for some reason UART pins
       are left floating and therefore cause unexpected break conditions.
  - Decrease DMA zone size configuration.
  - Enable tmpfs POSIX ACL configuration.
  - Re-enable L2 cache kernel configuration as it is now only enabled if actually present on chip.
  - Implement resistive touch screen driver using ADCs and GPIOs.
  - Add Eon Silicon Solutions manufacturer ID and integrate mxc_nand platform data handling.
  - Disable NAND controller software ECC in order to use hardware ECC.
  - Enable ADC driver as well as debugfs file system.
  - Fix DCU clock rounding, set DCU clock to 150.7 MHz, increase display pin drive strength and
      configure DCU for VESA VGA with a 30 MHz pixel clock
  - Enable CPU idle, NEON, ASRC and printk time.
  - Initial support based off Timesys' implementation for Freescale's Vybrid Tower System TWR-VF65GS10:
    - New machine ID.
    - FEC1 only.
    - ESDHC2 only with card detect interrupt.
    - PLL5 based RMII clocking (e.g. no external crystal).
    - VESA VGA display timing (tested with 5.7" EDT ET057090DHU).
    - Default UART_A on SCI0.
    - UART_A and UART_C I/O muxing.
    - I2C real time clock on carrier board.
    - Early boot console support.
    - 8-bit NAND.
- rootfs / oe-core:
  - OpenEmbedded: layers from dylan
      xserver version 1.14
      gtk+ 2.24.15
      midori 0.5.0
  - NEON and hard float enabled build
  - feed-config: use the new feed armv7ahf-vfp-neon
  - evdev: backport V2.8.1 from dora to get a fix for multitouch events
  - browser: use midori
  - burnflash: script for config block generation
  - systemd-journald: limit journal size
- sources git.toradex.com linux/u-boot branches colibri_vf tag Colibri_VF50_LinuxImageV2.1Beta1_20131022

Known Issues:
- LVDS aka TFTLCD resolution hard-coded in kernel to VESA VGA resolution.
