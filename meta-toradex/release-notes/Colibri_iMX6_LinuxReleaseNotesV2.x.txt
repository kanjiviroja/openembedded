Linux Image V2.5 Beta 2 (November 6, 2015)
- U-Boot boot loader:
  - add return code for cfgblock commands which allows scripting
  - increase TFTP blocksize for better performance
  - fix setup of I2C3
  - enabled zero bootdelay check (allows entering U-Boot when bootdelay is 0)
  - enable eMMC boot support commands (e.g. /dev/mmcblk0boot0)
  - boot U-Boot from the eMMC boot area (/dev/mmcblk0boot0)
  - move environment to the end of the eMMC boot area before the config block
  - enable crc32 verify support
- Linux kernel:
  - migrate to Linux 3.14.28 kernel, based on Freescale's BSP release imx_3.14.28_1.0.0_ga
  - optional RS485 is not yet migrated
  - automatic USB device/host detection using USBC_DET pin
  - changed Fusion multi touch event reporting to adhere to multitouch slot
- Linux user-space:
  - updated to latest Angstrom 2015.06/OpenEmbedded fido:
    - glibc 2.22
    - systemd 219
    - Xorg 1.16.1
  - glibc: force memcpy_arm to improve memcpy performance
  - fw_printenv/setenv: follow U-Boot environment move
  - updated Vivante binary graphics/multimedia drivers (some gstreamer plugins
    changed their names, notably mfw_v4lsink to imxv4l2sink)
  - fix USB RNDIS operation (still racy due to networkd bug)
- OpenEmbedded build system:
  - local.conf: add Toradex source mirror as pre-mirror
- Update scripts:
  - Ethernet aka TFTP update: provide option to split rootfs output file
  - update.sh: delete intermediate files after use
  - improved update.sh to use module type specific folders allowing update of
    different modules with just one update media

  - repository linux-toradex branch toradex_imx_3.14.28_1.0.0_ga
  - repository u-boot-toradex branch 2015.04-toradex

Known Issues:
- When migrating from V2.4 sometimes the bootpartition gets not enabled
    resulting in the old bootloader being used. For a workaround see:
    http://developer.toradex.com/software-resources/arm-family/linux/linux/release-details?view=all&issue=14774
- USB RNDIS is racy due to networkd bug
- some USB Thumb drivers don't work well in U-Boot
- connecting an analogue mic to the on module codec resets the codec, so that
    neither headphone out nor mic in works anymore. Workaround: Have mic
    connected before boot or change the output source between DAC/LineIn
- on first boot the resizing process adversely affects system performance for
    the first few minutes until completed
- Display resolution can be set for some output configurations, set the U-Boot
    environment variable vidargs accordingly.
- X uses only the fb0 device
- Ethernet aka TFTP update requires manual splitting of the root.ext3 file
    which can be taken care of by the -c argument of our update.sh script.
