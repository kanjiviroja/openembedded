- U-Boot:
  - Add more UART configurations to the device trees allowing easy switching of
    the console UART port by changing the UART base address of the console node
    within the device tree.
  - Fix EHCI periodic list handling.
  - Add default VESA VGA vidargs for our now modedb enabled kernel. This allows
    easy specifying an alternate parallel RGB resolution.
  - Fix usbboot option to be more in-line with how we do optional MMC/SD card
    boot on Colibri VF50/VF61. Loads the uimage kernel from the first partition
    being formatted as VFAT and instructs the kernel to mount the second
    partition formatted as ext3 as root file system.
- Linux kernel:
  - Use TPS6591X IRQ base define to calculate correct IRQ number.
  - Remove vdd_hdmi_con regulator from dc1 since we don't have a dedicated
    regulator for this connector on our baseboards.
  - Fix SATA suspend/resume by adding avdd_plle regulator.
  - Fix HDMI suspend/resume by avoiding division by zero oops.
  - Add GPIO keyboard configuration.
  - Use integer for root_bus_nr in Tegra PCIe driver.
  - Add STMPE ADC driver using IIO framework
    (see http://developer.toradex.com/knowledge-base/adc-(linux)).
  - Use modedb to specify framebuffer resolution (see
    http://developer.toradex.com/knowledge-base/framebuffer-(linux) and
    http://developer.toradex.com/knowledge-base/x-server-(linux)).
  - Check null pointers for sysfs calls.
  - Hack to avoid 24 Hz mode in X resulting in no display at all. This has been
    encountered using e.g. a Samsung SyncMaster F2380 if connected by HDMI.
  - Add kernel parameters to change RGB clock polarity.
  - Re-work Fusion multi-touch touchscreen driver.
  - Before updating modes on HDMI hotplug, check if framebuffer is registered
    at all. This allows to disable framebuffers completely.
- rootfs / oe-core:
  - Fix build and texinfo errors for stress.
  - Add sections for both monitor outputs to xorg.conf. Add example
    configuration to disable an output as well as select preferred mode.
  - Add entry for fusion touchscreen driver to xorg.conf.
  - Add fstrim from util-linux.
  - Add kernel module for fusion touch screens (see
      http://developer.toradex.com/knowledge-base/capacitive-multi-touch-display-(linux)).
  - burnflash: Account for fs overhead and many files.

Linux Image V2.1 Beta 1 (October 22, 2013)
- U-Boot:
  - Fix possible uninitialised array member issue in serial number to
      hexadecimal coded decimal conversion routine (e.g. as used for
      /proc/cpuinfo in Linux).

      boot as USB host functionality on OTG1 port is anyway broken under U-Boot.
- Linux kernel:
  - Fix several HDMI hang issues.
  - Exported Apalis GPIOs via SYSFS (see /sys/class/gpio).
  - Support default watchdog API (see
      http://developer.toradex.com/knowledge-base/watchdog-(linux)).
  - Disable magic SysRq key configuration as this is not only a potential
       security thread but can cause serious trouble if for some reason UART
	   pins are left floating and therefore cause unexpected break conditions.
  - HDMI: Retry EDID reads up to 4 times until failing.

- rootfs / oe-core:
  - OpenEmbedded: layers updated to dylan
      xserver update to version 1.14
